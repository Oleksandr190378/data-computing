            "\n",
            "1. **2020**:\n",
            "   - The total general and administrative expenses for the year were reported as $1,991,918, primarily attributed to employment costs. However, specific lease expenses for 2020 are not detailed in the provided context. It is noted that the company had relatively low operating expenses at that time.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **2021**:\n",
            "   - The total general and administrative expenses increased significantly to $12,354,241. This increase can be attributed to changes in management and business teams, which led to higher professional expenses and stock incentive expenses.\n",
            "   - The context does not provide specific lease expense figures for 2021, but it indicates that many employees were allowed to accelerate the vesting of their shares, which may have impacted overall compensation and related expenses, including lease obligations indirectly.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **2022**:\n",
            "   - The company reported a total lease expense of **$91,879** for the year, which includes:\n",
            "     - Operating lease cost: **$60,578**\n",
            "     - Short-term lease rent expense: **$31,301**\n",
            "   - The company recognized right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet, indicating a shift in how lease expenses are recorded due to the adoption of new accounting standards (ASC 842).\n",
            "   - The total operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2022, amounted to **$904,132**, with current liabilities of **$269,675** and non-current liabilities of **$634,457**.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Trends and Fluctuations\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Trend Analysis**:\n",
            "  - There is a notable increase in lease-related expenses from 2020 to 2022, particularly in 2022, where the company began to recognize significant right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.\n",
            "  - The increase in lease expenses in 2022 reflects the company's commitment to leasing office space in New York and Shenzhen, which may indicate growth or expansion efforts.\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Fluctuations**:\n",
            "  - The absence of specific lease expense figures for 2020 and 2021 makes it challenging to quantify fluctuations accurately. However, the substantial increase in total general and administrative expenses in 2021 suggests that lease expenses may have also contributed to this rise, albeit indirectly.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) and Consolidated Financial Statements\n",
            "\n",
            "- The MD&A section (Item 7) would typically discuss the implications of lease expenses on the company's financial condition and operational results. However, the provided context does not include specific excerpts from this section.\n",
            "- The Consolidated Financial Statements (Item 8) reflect the company's lease obligations through the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, which are critical for understanding the company's financial position.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Relevant Notes and Disclosures\n",
            "\n",
            "- The notes to the consolidated financial statements provide insights into the company's lease agreements, indicating that they do not contain material residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.\n",
            "- The maturity of operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2022, shows a structured payment plan over the next few years, which could impact cash flow and financial planning.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Risk Factors (Item 1A)\n",
            "\n",
            "- While specific risk factors related to lease expenses are not detailed in the provided context, potential risks could include:\n",
            "  - Changes in market conditions affecting lease rates.\n",
            "  - Economic downturns that could impact the company's ability to meet lease obligations.\n",
            "  - The impact of any future restructuring or changes in business strategy that may lead to adjustments in leased office space.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Conclusion\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, the company's lease expenses have shown a significant increase from 2020 to 2022, particularly in 2022, where the company began to recognize substantial lease liabilities and right-of-use assets. The trends indicate a strategic move towards leasing office space, likely in response to growth initiatives. However, the lack of detailed figures for 2020 and 2021 limits a comprehensive year-over-year analysis. Future financial statements and MD&A sections will be crucial for understanding the ongoing implications of these lease expenses on the company's financial health.\n"
