      "What Trump could do on day one in the White House\n",
      "Donald Trump and his Republican Party have an ambitious agenda and control of US Congress.\n",
      "Trump has said he will \"make heads spin\" as he moves full-speed ahead after his inauguration on 20 January.\n",
      "His team has said to expect a flurry of executive orders - directives from the US president - out of the Oval Office in the first week.\n",
      "Policy experts and lawyers are already drafting those orders as part of the administration's transition.\n",
      "Still, advocacy groups and Democratic state governors have vowed to challenge at least some of those plans.\n",
      "Here is what the president-elect has said about his second-term priorities.\n",
      "Immigration and the border\n",
      "Trump press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News on Sunday \"we know he promised to sign an executive order to secure the southern border\".\n",
      "\"We know that on day one he is going to launch the largest mass deportation of illegal immigrants in American history,\" she said.\n",
      "In the week since his re-election, Trump has prioritised filling leadership positions that would oversee immigration, suggesting he is preparing to tackle his plans for border policy early.\n",
      "He tapped veteran immigration official Tom Homan as his \"border tsar\"; selected South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem to oversee homeland security; and appointed Steven Miller as White House deputy chief of staff for policy. Mr Miller is best known for shaping some of Trump's most restrictive policies on illegal immigration during his first term.\n",
      "Any mass deportation programme could face logistical difficulties as well as a flurry of legal challenges from immigration and human rights activists.\n",
      "Trump could also re-implement his \"Remain in Mexico\" policy that required asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while claims are processed.\n",
      "President Joe Biden had called the programme \"inhumane\" and tried to end it on his first day in office, but faced legal challenges. In 2022, the Supreme Court allowed him to move ahead.\n",
      "During the Trump administration, about 70,000 asylum seekers were returned to Mexico to wait for their hearings.\n",
      "Another day one promise was to end birthright citizenship - the 150-year-old principle that says anyone born on US soil is an American citizen.\n",
      "\"We're going to end that because it's ridiculous,\" Trump told NBC News anchor Kristen Welker on Meet the Press in December.\n",
      "But it's not clear how Trump plans to achieve this policy. He has pledged an executive order but birthright citizenship is explicitly guaranteed by the US Constitution, meaning it can only be altered under specific circumstances.\n",
      "He would need states to agree to a national convention or a two-thirds vote in favour in the narrowly split Congress to propose a change, then subsequent approval by three-fourths of state legislatures - of which Republicans control just over half.\n",
      "6 January\n",
      "Trump did not mention pardons in his victory speech, but he has long suggested that pardoning those convicted of storming the Capitol in 2021 would be a priority.\n",
      "Asked by Ms Welker on Meet the Press, Trump said he \"most likely\" would issue pardons.\n",
      "\"I'll do it very quickly,\" he said, calling the convictions \"unfair\".\n",
      "US presidents have wide authority to forgive people convicted of federal crimes or end their prison sentences. Prosecutors may also decide to drop pending cases depending on who Trump might choose to pardon.\n",
      "What's less clear is who might get a pardon.\n",
      "At one point, Trump told CNN: \"I am inclined to pardon many of them. I can't say for every single one, because a couple of them, probably they got out of control.\"\n",
      "Ms Leavitt told the Washington Post that he will decide “on a case-by-case basis when he is back in the White House”.\n",
      "More than 1,500 people were arrested in connection with the Capitol riot. According to federal numbers, more than 750 of them were sentenced for crimes ranging from trespassing to assaulting police officers and seditious conspiracy.\n",
      "Jack Smith\n",
      "Trump has also faced his own legal challenges over his actions following the 2020 election and a separate classified documents case.\n",
      "Special Counsel Jack Smith, a veteran prosecutor appointed to oversee the US Department of Justice's investigations into Trump, filed charges, to which the president-elect has pleaded not guilty.\n",
      "This week, sources told CBS News that Mr Smith plans to resign before Trump takes office and avoid Trump's promises to fire him. The BBC's US media partner also reported that his office would wind down the two cases it was pursuing against Trump.\n",
      "It remains unclear whether Trump and his supporters will still try to punish Mr Smith. Congressional Republicans have reportedly implied they intend to investigate his work.\n",
      "\"Jack Smith’s abuse of the justice system cannot go unpunished\", billionaire and Trump ally Elon Musk posted on social media.\n",
      "Trump regularly railed against the special counsel in interviews and online, calling him a \"crooked person\", a \"scoundrel\" and other insults.\n",
      "Smith's cases were already facing an uncertain future. The Supreme Court ruled in July that presidents have partial immunity from criminal prosecution for their conduct in office, undermining Mr Smith's work.\n",
      "Trump's electoral win also gives him the power to pardon himself of any federal crimes, though no president has done so before.\n",
      "Paris climate agreement\n",
      "In his 2016 campaign, Trump made withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement a priority. Within six months of taking office, the United States moved to exit the landmark deal.\n",
      "President Joe Biden made rejoining the agreement one of his top priorities when he ran against Trump in 2020. Biden signed a letter requesting the US be readmitted on his first day in office.\n",
      "How will Trump respond in his second term? Media reports suggest that his team is preparing orders to withdraw once again when he takes office in January.\n",
      "Leaving the agreement would mean the US is no longer beholden to meeting set carbon emissions reductions.\n",
      "Among other priorities at odds with the Paris standards, Trump has said he wants to prioritise US production of oil and gas. He promised to quickly expedite permitting and fracking - \"We’re drilling, drilling, drilling,\" he told Fox News host Sean Hannity last year.\n",
      "Trump has also criticised the Biden administration's plans to expand wind energy and increase electric car production, which could be early targets in his new administration.\n",
      "Russia and Ukraine\n",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump said he could end the war in Ukraine \"in a day\". He has also repeatedly criticised the US government's continued support of Ukraine, casting the war as a drain on resources.\n",
      "He has not yet given specifics on how he would negotiate the war's end beyond saying he would help the two countries strike a deal.\n",
      "Since his re-election, Trump has spoken to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a call that lasted \"about half an hour\", with billionaire Elon Musk also taking part. A source told the BBC that \"it was not really a conversation to talk about very substantial things\".\n",
      "The Kremlin denied that Trump held a call with Vladimir Putin, though media reports said Trump warned the Russian president against escalating the war in Ukraine.\n",
      "Trade and economy\n",
      "The economy is an issue that Trump heavily campaigned on, vowing to end inflation as soon as he takes office.\n",
      "“We will target everything from car affordability to housing affordability to insurance costs to supply chain issues,” Trump has said.\n",
      "“I will instruct my cabinet that I expect results within the first 100 days, or much sooner than that.”\n",
      "He said he would sign an executive order that directs every cabinet secretary and agency head to “use every tool and authority at their disposal” to defeat inflation and to bring consumer prices down.\n",
      "Trump’s plan includes imposing tariffs on imported goods, especially those coming in from China, arguing that these taxes would keep manufacturing jobs in the US.\n",
      "\"I'm a big believer in tariffs. I think tariffs are the most beautiful word. I think they're beautiful. It's going to make us rich,\" the Republican said on Meet the Press.\n",
      "It’s still unclear how widespread these tariffs will be, but Trump has raised the prospect of at least a 10% across-the-board tariff on imported goods, as well as a 60% import tax on goods from China.\n",
      "He also vowed to target Canada and Mexico with his tariffs.\n",
      "“I’m going to inform (the Mexican president) on Day 1 or sooner that if they don’t stop this onslaught of criminals and drugs coming into our country, I’m going to immediately impose a 25% tariff on everything they send into the US,” he has said.\n",
      "In December, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made a last-minute trip to visit Trump at Mar-a-Lago, reportedly seeking to head-off what would be a punishing tax on Canadian goods.\n",
      "These tariffs would probably not need congressional approval.\n",
      "Trump already introduced tariffs in his first term, citing Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which empowers a president to impose duties on goods that could affect US national security.\n",
      "Another promise is to “end the Biden-Harris war on American energy”, Trump has said, vowing to ramp up oil drilling and fracking as a way to lower the cost of energy bills for consumers.\n",
      "Trump can do this with an executive order that rolls back environmental protections, which would allow him to halt clean energy projects and scrap climate targets set by the Biden administration.\n",
      "The president-elect has also vowed to fire Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, on day one. Gensler, who was appointed by Biden, pushed for climate disclosure rules and strong enforcement of the cryptocurrency market.\n",
      "Trump has championed cryptocurrency, and his election saw the value of Bitcoin go up by 30% in a week due to an expectation that his administration will be more crypto-friendly.\n",
      "Title X\n",
      "Donald Trump has vowed to undo the changes made by President Biden to Title X, the country’s only national, federally-funded family planning programme.\n",
      "In 2019, during his first term, Trump’s administration implemented a new rule that prohibited any health provider in the Title X network from mentioning abortion to patients, even if a patient raised questions about it themselves.\n",
      "The change effectively stripped tens of millions of dollars from organisations such as Planned Parenthood that offer or refer patients for abortions.\n",
      "But just months later, when Biden took office, he had that policy reversed.\n",
      "Now, it’s expected that Trump will change the rules again.\n"

      "How Trump and Musk's interventions prompt fresh diplomatic challengeReutersIn Donald Trump's first term, governments around the world braced for his morning social media posts. What policy would be reversed, what insult thrown? Four years on, diplomats are once more getting twitchy when the sun rises on America's east coast.Back then, they learned to take Trump - as the adage had it - \"seriously but not literally\". Despite many campaign promises, he did not take the US out of Nato or lock up Hilary Clinton. But can ministers stay so sanguine a second time around?Trump's latest morning salvo criticised the UK government's decision to increase taxes on oil and gas firms working in the North Sea, in part to help fund renewable energy.On his platform, Truth Social, Trump responded to a report about a US oil firm leaving the region, saying: \"The U.K. is making a very big mistake. Open up the North Sea. Get rid of Windmills!\"Was this merely a familiar defence of a US firm by Trump and a repetition of his pro-fossil fuel instincts? Or was it evidence of a greater willingness by the president-elect to intervene in an ally's own domestic policies?The main difference - four years on - is that Trump is no longer alone at the keyboard; his increasingly powerful fellow traveller, Elon Musk, is even more prolific, using his own platform, X, to attack the British government across the board. He has criticised its handling of last summer's riots, the running of the economy and now especially its attitude towards child abuse scandals.Musk has issued a torrent of tweets attacking Sir Keir Starmer personally, accusing the prime minister of not doing enough to prosecute child grooming gangs while he was the director of public prosecutions.British politicians cannot stem these posts from across the Atlantic. But they can control their reaction. During Trump's first term, governments - and news desks - learned to pause and take a moment before responding to - or reporting - the latest electronic missives from the White House.Thus far the Conservatives have chosen to engage with and echo Musk's agenda. The party leader, Kemi Badenoch, said a full national inquiry into organised grooming gangs was \"long overdue\".PA MediaMusk has voiced support for the jailed far-right activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy RobinsonBut the Conservatives balked at Musk's apparent support for the jailed far-right activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson. Musk has shared several posts on X calling for the release of Yaxley-Lennon, who was jailed in October after admitting contempt of court by repeating false claims against a Syrian refugee.Alicia Kearns, the Conservative shadow safeguarding minister, said it was \"frankly dangerous\" of Musk to be \"lionising people like Tommy Robinson\".As for Labour, it seems keen to avoid picking a fight with one of the world's richest men who could one day fund a rival political party. Nigel Farage's Reform Party has said Musk is among \"a number of billionaires\" interested in donating money for their campaigns.Health Secretary Wes Streeting said Musk's comments about child grooming scandals were \"misjudged and certainly misinformed\" but asked the billionaire to work with the UK government to tackle online child abuse.UK politicians are not alone in being the target of Musk's increasingly eccentric interventions. He has described Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany as a \"fool\" and the country's head of state, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, as \"an anti-democratic tyrant\". He has also called Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada \"an insufferable tool\" who \"won't be in power for much longer\".Monitoring closelySo the challenge once again for politicians in Britain and around the world is to work out which, if any, of these social media outbursts and interventions merit a response.In Whitehall, there is some hope the arrival of Lord Mandelson as the new British ambassador might help stem the flow of personal vituperation across the Atlantic. There is also weight being placed on Trump's affection for the UK and the Royal Family; he had a good meeting with the Prince of Wales in Paris in December after the opening of Notre Dame. Other officials are even musing that the relationship between Trump and Musk might prove too combustible in office.But for now officials are monitoring their timelines closely. US social media diplomacy is back and some of it is heading our way.See alsoWhy 2025 promises plenty of political fireworksElon Musk's 'social experiment on humanity': How X evolved in 2024Why 2024 was Prince William's 'annus horribilis'Kemi BadenochElon MuskKeir StarmerTommy RobinsonDonald TrumpDiplomacy\n"

      "Посилення українських наступальних операцій у Курській області може бути початковим етапом узгодженої української операції в Курській області чи в інших місцях на фронті, хоча в ISW не готові дати будь-який конкретний прогноз, йдеться у звіті американського Інституту вивчення війни (ISW).\n",
      "«Українські сили нещодавно досягли тактичних успіхів на тлі продовження інтенсивних наступальних операцій на українському виступі в Курській області 6 січня. Геолокаційні кадри, опубліковані 5 і 6 січня, вказують на те, що українські сили нещодавно просунулися вперед у південному Бердині, центральній частині Руського Поперечного і центральній частині Новосотницького (всі на північний схід від Суджі)», – кажуть аналітики.\n",
      "В ISW зазначили, що 6 січня російські сили намагалися використати українські атаки на північний схід від Суджі, щоб атакувати в інших частинах українського виступу в Курській області. Геолокаційні кадри 5 січня показують, що війська Росії просунулися на захід від малої Локні (на північний захід від Суджі).\n",
      "5 січня керівник Центру протидії дезінформації РНБО Андрій Коваленко повідомив, що «російські війська в Курську зазнали атаки з кількох напрямків, що стало для них несподіванкою».\n",
      "За даними американського Інституту вивчення війни, українські війська відновили наступальні операції щонайменше на трьох напрямках в межах українського виступу в Курській області Росії і досягли тактичного просування 5 січня.\n",
      "Збройні сили України почали операцію в Курській області 6 серпня, зайнявши понад 1 тисячу квадратних кілометрів. Потім російська армія за допомогою військ КНДР змогла відбити частину території.\n",
      "У листопаді агенція Reuters із посиланням на високопоставлене українське військове джерело, яке працює в Генеральному штабі України, повідомила, що Україна через російські контратаки втратила понад 40% території в Курській області РФ, яку вона захопила під час бойових дій у серпні. За даними джерела, Росія розгорнула близько 59 тисяч військових у Курській області.\n",

      "Як працюють санкції проти Росії\n",
      "Економіст компанії Ukraine Economic Outlook Адріан Пантюхов, передає 24 Канал з посиланням ефір телеканалу FREEДOM, попри все через санкції для Росії значно здорожчає виробництво озброєнь. Відтак Росія вже почала виготовляти менше озброєння, ніж могла б до введення обмежень.\n",
      "Читайте також Центробанк Росії переглянув рівень ключової ставки: чи вгамувався ріст інфляції\n",
      "Зауважте! Євросоюз вже запровадив проти Росії та її союзників 15 пакетів санкцій. Майже таку ж кількість застосували й США.\n",
      "Як пояснює економіст, суть санкцій полягає в тому, що ними не можна закрити одночасно всі \"лазівки\". Річ у тім, що до того, як санкції запроваджуються, цих \"лазівок\" просто не існує.\n",
      "Обхід санкцій якраз і передбачає, що для того, щоб пройти певні обмеження, шукається обхідний шлях через 234 особи. Це дуже здорожує весь процес купівлі, ускладнює логістику, але, однак, усе-таки дає змогу Росії отримувати компоненти для виробництва своїх озброєнь,\n",
      "– каже Адріан Пантюхов.\n",
      "Крім того, ситуація зараз така, що Росія досі отримує компоненти для ракет й може їх виробляти. Водночас невідомо, як би було насправді, якби санкцій не було взагалі.\n",
      "Який результат вторинних санкцій\n",
      "За словами економіста Пантюхова, міжнародні партнери починають працювати вже над вторинними санкціями. Це ускладнює процес для компаній, які через 2 – 4 країни планували перепродавати компоненти в бік Росії.\n",
      "Наприклад, за останні пів року можемо бачити, як китайські банки починають запитувати у Росію набагато більші відсотки. Крім того, вони запроваджують дуже жорсткі перевірки самих контрагентів, це призводить до того, що замість одного тижня саме постачання може затягнутися на місяці,\n",
      "– додає пан Адріан.\n",
      "Він зауважує, що попри все потрібно посилювати санкції, особливо вторинні, щоб ускладнювати процес постачання і виробництва озброєння, робити його дуже болючим і чутливим. Тобто щоб для Росії одна ракета обходилася якомога дорожче.\n"
